# JavaFX-Pomodoro_Timer_App

Basic application built using JavaFX (Java and FXML), allowing the user to switch between timed FOCUS and BREAK modes and log activity. 
Very shortened example:

<div>
<img height= "500px" width="500px" src="https://github.com/strudelPie/media1/blob/main/Pomodoro%20App%20Gif.gif" />
</div>
